# lab-11-book-app


**Author**: Ailleen Murphy  Brad Smialek
**Version**: 1.0.0 (increment the patch/fix version number if you make more commits past your first submission)

## Overview
#Feature 1
As a user, I want my application to load quickly so that I have an enjoyable experience.
Given that a user opens the application in the browser
When the user navigates to the home page
Then the index should load without a flash of unstyled content (FOUC)

#Feature 2
As a user, I want to search the Google Books API so that I can view the results of my search.
Given that the user enters a seach query
When the user submits the search form
Then the search query should be included in a request to the Google Books API



## Getting Started
#Feature 1 Steps
1 Create a basic server.js file
2 Install any necessary NPM packages
3 Create a views folder, with a pages subfolder. Within this subfolder, create a file called index.ejs
4 Create a basic HTML scaffold in your index.ejs file which contains several elements that you can view in the browser, such as a heading element that says "Hello World". Also create a basic CSS file with several rules, such as an obvious background color
5 For testing purposes, include a temporary route such as app.get('/hello') and render your index.ejs file. Turn on your server and validate that the HTML elements and basic CSS styles are being rendered as expected

#Feature 2 Steps
1 In your index.ejs file, create a search field. Add the ability for a user to indicate if they are searching by title or author, as demonstrated in class.
2 This form should be displayed to the user on page load, so your corresponding endpoint should be /, the home route.
3 Make a PR to master and confirm functionality on your deployed site.
