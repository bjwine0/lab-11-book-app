## Overview
#Feature 1
As a user, I want my application to load quickly so that I have an enjoyable experience.
Given that a user opens the application in the browser
When the user navigates to the home page
Then the index should load without a flash of unstyled content (FOUC)



## Getting Started
#Feature 1 Steps
1 Create a basic server.js file
2 Install any necessary NPM packages
3 Create a views folder, with a pages subfolder. Within this subfolder, create a file called index.ejs
4 Create a basic HTML scaffold in your index.ejs file which contains several elements that you can view in the browser, such as a heading element that says "Hello World". Also create a basic CSS file with several rules, such as an obvious background color
5 For testing purposes, include a temporary route such as app.get('/hello') and render your index.ejs file. Turn on your server and validate that the HTML elements and basic CSS styles are being rendered as expected


## Architecture
#Feature 1 - Html/ Css/ Javascript / EJS
